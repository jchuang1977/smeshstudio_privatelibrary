/** Class HTTPServer for use with <a href="http://mbed.org/users/samux/code/WiflyInterface/">WiflyInterface</a>.
* This class is a simple implementation of an HTTP Server for use with the WiFly interface.
* The class will listen for incoming connections on the (configurable) HTTP port. For each 
* incoming connection, one request will be processed. 
* After instantiating this class, add all required handlers using the \c addHandler function,
* replace the default error handler using \c addErrorHandler if needed and call the \c start
* method to initialize the class.
* You need to continuously poll for any new incoming connections after one request has been
* served using the \c poll member function.
*
* \b Example:
* @code
* #include "mbed.h"
* #include "HTTPServer.h"
* #include "LocalFileSystem.h"
*
* LocalFileSystem local("local"); 
*
* void main(void)
* {
*     HTTPServer svr;
*     svr.mount("/local/", "/");
*     svr.addHandler<HTTPFsRequestHandler>( "/" );
*     svr.start();
*     while(1)
*     {
*         if (svr.poll() < 0)
*             exit(0);
*     }
* }
* @endcode
*
* An alternate approach e.g. if you need to perform additional tasks using the EthernetInterface
* there is the possibility to provide the EthernetInterface object in an initialized and connected
* state. __NOTE: You should choose this scenario for compatibility reasons.___
*
* \b Example2:
* @code
* #include "mbed.h"
* #include "HTTPServer.h"
* #include "EthernetInterface.h"
* #include "LocalFileSystem.h"
*
* LocalFileSystem local("local");
* EthernetInterface eth;
*
* void main(void)
* {
*     HTTPServer svr;
*     //    Initialize the ethernet interface
*     if (eth.init() != 0) {
*         printf("Initialization of EthernetInterface failed !");
*         exit(0);
*     }
*     //    Connect using DHCP
*     if (eth.connect() !=0) {
*         printf("Failed to connect using DHCP !");
*         exit(0);
*     }
*     
*     // Moint the local file system and provide a handler for 'root'.
*     svr.mount("/local/", "/");
*     svr.addHandler<HTTPFsRequestHandler>( "/" );
*     // Start the server on port 80, providing our own ethernet interface object.
*     svr.start(80, &eth);
*     while(1)
*     {
*         if (svr.poll() < 0)
*             exit(0);
*     }
* }
* @endcode
*
